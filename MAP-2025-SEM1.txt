a. Introduction to Data Analysis & Excel Overview

i. Data Analysis :

Data Analysis is the systematic and meticulous process of observing or inspecting data, cleansing or cleaning of data, transforming data, and modeling data to uncover and reveal useful information, draw conclusions, and support informed decision-making. 

It is a critical component of data science in helping businesses and researchers translate raw numbers into actionable insights which finally helps in improving business, increasing profits, enhancing effeciciencies and attaining business goals with business intelligence.

ii. Data Analysis Process :

The process of data analysis is typically iterative or repeatative and involves several important stages:

a. Define Objectives: Clearly state the problem you are trying to solve or the specific questions the data needs to answer. This sets the scope and direction for the entire analysis.

b. Data Collection: Gather the relevant data from various sources like databases, excel spreadsheets, data surveys, or create your own data.

c. Data Cleaning/Wrangling: This is often the most time-consuming step. It involves preparing the data by:

	Handling missing values (e.g., deleting records or imputing data).

	Removing duplicates.

	Correcting inconsistencies and errors (e.g., misspelled categories or incorrect formats).

	Standardizing and transforming data to a usable format.

d. Data Analysis: Apply analytical and statistical techniques to the cleaned data to find patterns, relationships, and trends. This step includes:

	Four Types of Data Analysis

	A. Descriptive Analysis: Summarizing what happened (e.g., calculating mean, median, mode, or charting frequency). Understanding of data.

	B. Diagnostic Analysis: Determining why it happened (e.g., using correlation or regression). Determine the data.

	C. Predictive Analysis: Forecasting what might happen next (e.g., using trend analysis). Forecasting or future prediction. 

	D. Prescriptive Analysis: Recommending a course of action. Taking action.

Description, Diagnosis, Prediction, Prescription

e. Interpretation and Visualization: Translate the analytical results into meaningful insights and Data visualization by drawing charts, graphs, and dashboards which are essential to make complex data easy to understand for non-technical audiences and management staff.

f. Communication: Present the findings and conclusions in a clear, convincing narrative often called data storytelling to guide decision-making. Generally done by preparing powerpoint show.

- Data Analysis Cycle


iii. MS Excel for Data Analysis :

Microsoft Excel is one of the most widely used tools for initial and intermediate data analysis due to its accessibility, grid-based structure, and powerful built-in features.

Key features of Excel :

- Built-in functions and formulas

- Visualization tools (charts, conditional formatting)

- Pivot tables and data cleaning options

Excel Interface Overview :

Workbook – A file containing multiple worksheets.

Worksheet – A grid of rows and columns where data is entered.

Cell – The intersection of a row and column (e.g., A1).

Ribbon - Rhe top level menus of Excel


b. Entering, Editing & Formatting Data 

1. Enter data into a worksheet

2. Edit data using F2 key

3. Format Data 
   1. SpreadSheet heading
   2. Column name alignment - left, center, right
   3. Data alignment - left, center, right
   4. Column names with bold, italic, underline
   5. Auto-complete numeric series using CTRL-Mouseclick and mouse drag
   6. Adding Table to the spreadsheet
   7. Inserting row and column in the sheet

c. Sorting & Filtering Data

Sorting lets you rearrange your data (like student names, marks, or ages) in ascending or descending order for easier analysis.

Filtering a column in Excel helps you quickly view only the rows that meet certain conditions — for example, showing only students with a percentage above 80%.   

Add a condition in number filter.

Use Ctrl + Shift + L to quickly toggle filters on/off.

Filters don’t delete data — they just hide the rows that don’t match your conditions.

d. Basic Formulas (SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT)

- Each formula in excel starts with a = sign


sum() function makes a sum of all data in a column ex. =sum(e4:e13)

average() function calculated average of a column  ex. =average(e4:e13)

count() funcrion colunts the no of values in a column ex. =count(e54:e13)

- Similarly any math expression can be written using = sign

e. Conditional Formatting & Data Cleaning

Conditional Formatting helps highlight cells based on specific conditions or rules 

— making data patterns easier to spot visually.

Common Use-Cases:

Highlight top or low scores

Show duplicates

Color-code based on performance or value range

Examples:
Example 1: Highlight percentages above 75%

Select the column with percentages (e.g., D2:D11).

Go to Home → Conditional Formatting → Highlight Cells Rules → Greater Than…

Enter 75 → Choose a green fill → Click OK

Now, all students scoring above 75% will be highlighted in green.

Example 2: Color scale for performance

Select the percentage column

Go to Home → Conditional Formatting → Color Scales → Green-Yellow-Red

Green = High values

Red = Low values

Instantly visualize student performance range.

Example 3: Highlight duplicate names

Select the Name column.

Click Home → Conditional Formatting → Highlight Cells Rules → Duplicate Values

Pick a color → Click OK.

Duplicate student names (if any) will be highlighted.

2. Data Cleaning in Excel

Data cleaning ensures accuracy by removing or correcting inconsistencies before analysis.

Steps to Clean Data:
Step 1: Remove extra spaces

Select the name column (e.g., B2:B11).

Use the TRIM formula:

=TRIM(B2)

This removes unwanted spaces before/after text.

Step 2: Remove duplicates

Select your dataset (A1:D11).

Go to Data → Remove Duplicates.

Choose the columns to check (e.g., Roll No or Name).

Click OK → Excel removes duplicate rows automatically.

Step 3: Handle missing data

If some cells are blank:

You can use Filter → Blanks to find them.

Or replace with “Not Available” using:
Home → Find & Select → Replace → Replace All

Step 4: Correct data types

Ensure numeric columns (like Age or Percentage) are formatted as Number and not Text.
→ Select the column → Home → Number group → Change format to “Number”

Module 2: Excel Functions

- Excel Functions are pre-built formulas that help you perform calculations, transform data, clean data, and automate analysis quickly and accurately. Functions save tremendous time, eliminate manual errors, and make your data analysis efficient and professional.

- There are 6 categories of excel functions.

b. Text Functions
c. Number or Numeric Functions
d. Date & Time Functions
e. Logical Functions (IF, AND, OR)
f. Lookup Functions (VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, XLOOKUP ***) - Most Important
g. Statistical Functions - Most Important


Structure of a function:
=FUNCTION_NAME(arguments)


Example:

=SUM(A1:A10)


Excel functions help in:

1. Data cleaning

2. Data Calculations

3. Creating reports

4. Automating repetitive tasks

5. Data lookup and transformation

b. Text Functions in Excel

Text functions are used to clean and transform text data such as names, categories, codes, etc.

1. UPPER()

Converts text to uppercase
Example:
=UPPER("excel") → EXCEL

2. LOWER()

Converts text to lowercase
=LOWER("DATA") → data

3. PROPER()

Capitalizes each word
=PROPER("prakash patil") → Prakash Patil

4. CONCAT() / CONCATENATE()

Joins text from multiple cells
=CONCATENATE(A2," ",B2) → joins first and last name

5. LEFT(), RIGHT(), MID()

Extract characters from text

LEFT(A1, 3) → First 3 letters

RIGHT(A1, 2) → Last 2 letters

MID(A1, 2, 3) → 3 characters starting from position 2

6. LEN()

Counts characters
=LEN(A2)

7. TRIM()

Removes extra spaces
=TRIM(" Shrikant ") → "Shrikant"

8. FIND()

Find position of text inside another text
=FIND("a", c4) → 2

## c. Number Functions in Excel
1. SUM()

Adds numbers
=SUM(C2:C12)

2. AVERAGE()

Calculates average
=AVERAGE(C2:C12)

3. MAX(), MIN()

Find highest/lowest value
=MAX(C2:C12)
=MIN(C2:C12)


4. ROUND(), ROUNDUP(), ROUNDDOWN()

ROUND(A2, 1) → round to 1 decimal

ROUNDUP(A2, 0) → always round up

ROUNDDOWN(A2, 0) → always round down

5. COUNT(), COUNTA(), COUNTIF()

COUNT = counts numbers

COUNTA = counts text + numbers

COUNTIF = counts values matching a condition
Example:
=COUNTIF(C2:C12, ">75")
=COUNTIFS(C4:C14,">60",C4:C14,">70")

d. Date & Time Functions
1. TODAY()

Returns today’s date
=TODAY()

2. NOW()

Returns current date + time
=NOW()

3. DATE(year, month, day)

=DATE(2025, 11, 16)

4. DATEDIF()

Calculate difference between dates
Example: Age calculation
=DATEDIF(B2, TODAY(), "Y")

5. DAY(), MONTH(), YEAR()

Extract day, month, year
=MONTH(A2) → 11

## e. Logical Functions (IF, AND, OR)

1. IF()

Makes decisions

=IF(C2>=75,"Pass","Fail")

2. AND()

Checks multiple conditions

=AND(C2>70, D2="Yes")

3. OR()

True if any condition is true

=OR(A2="HR", A2="Finance")

Nested IF Example
=IF(C2>=80,"A Grade", IF(C2>=60,"B Grade","C Grade"))

## f. Lookup Functions (MOST IMPORTANT)

Vlookup(), hlookup(), xlookup()

1. VLOOKUP()

Searches some data in excel, vertically or column-wise in a range of cells.

=VLOOKUP(B5, B5:D14, 3, FALSE)

B5: This is the lookup_value. It's the specific value you want to find, in this case, a cell containing an student rollno.

B5:D14: This is the table_array. It's the range of cells where the lookup will take place. The VLOOKUP will only search within the first column of this range.

3: This is the col_index_num. It specifies which column in the table_array contains the value you want to return. Here, it's the third column.

FALSE: This is the range_lookup argument. FALSE (or 0) tells the function to find an exact match for the lookup_value

2. HLOOKUP()

Searches some data in excel, horizontally or row-wise in a range of cells.


To use HLOOKUP, data must be arranged horizontally, like this:

Get Name of Roll No = 1

=HLOOKUP(colno, K4:N7, 2, FALSE)

Get Age of Roll No = 3

=HLOOKUP(3, K4:N7, 3, FALSE)


## g. Statistical Functions (MOST IMPORTANT)

- Mean, median, and mode are measures of central tendency or basic aspects that help describe the characteristics of a data set. They provide useful insights into the data by identifying its average value (mean), middle value (median), and most frequent value 
(mode).

1. AVERAGE()

Average of a set of data
=AVERAGE(C2:C12)

2. MEDIAN()

Middle value
=MEDIAN(C2:C12)

3. MODE()

Most repeated value
=MODE(C2:C12)

3. STDEV()

Standard deviation

=STDEV(C2:C12)

Dataset:
10, 12, 15, 18, 20


In statistics, the standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation of the values of a variable about its mean. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.

Steps of calculating Std Dev

Setp 1 : Arrange the data in ascending order (Not Imp)

10, 12, 15, 18, 20 (n = 5)

Setp 2 : Find the mean of from the data

mean = 15

Step 3 : Summation of data 

sum = (10-15)**2 + (12-15)**2 + (15-15)**2 + (18-15)**2 + (20-15)**2

Setp 4 : Find average of average by dividing sum by total no of terms

avg = sum / n-1

avg = sum / 4

Step 5 : Find the Square root 

stdev = sqrt(avg)

stdev = sqrt(((10-15)**2 + (12-15)**2 + (15-15)**2 + (18-15)**2 + (20-15)**2)) / 5)

3. VAR()
Variance
=STDEV(C2:C12)

Variance tells you how much the data values vary from the mean.

Low variance → data points are close to the mean

High variance → data points are spread out widely

Dataset:
10, 12, 15, 18, 20

Formula
=VAR(C2:C12)

Steps (Conceptually):

Calculate mean:
(10 + 12 + 15 + 18 + 20) / 5 = 15

Find squared difference from mean:

(10 - 15)² = 25

(12 - 15)² = 9

(15 - 15)² = 0

(18 - 15)² = 9

(20 - 15)² = 25

Sum = 68

Divide sum by (n – 1):
68 / 4 = 17


=VAR(C2:C12)


Module 3: Advanced Excel 

a. Data Validation (Drop-downs, Error Messages)
b. Advanced Functions (SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, AVERAGEIFS) - Imp Functions
c. Excel graphs and charts
d. Introduction to Pivot Tables 
f. Pivot Charts, Slicers & Timelines ****


a. Data Validation

- Data valiodation prevents the incorrect data entered into excel sheet or any cell of an sheet.

age : 200 - invalid data out of range (0 to 100)
age : abcd - invalid data

Data Validation helps control what users can enter in a cell.
Common use cases: drop-downs, date limits, number limits, custom rules, error messages.

1. Creating a Drop-down List

- The drop down list prevent data errors in a sheet

- The drop down list contain predefined values and user can selectgn onny from the list

Steps:

Select the cell → Go to Data tab → Data Validation

Allow → List

In "Source": type:

Pending, Approved, Rejected


OR
select a range: A2:A5

Now your cell has a drop-down.

2. Adding Input Message

Used to guide the user.

Example:

Title: Enter Status

Message: Choose from drop-down only.

This appears when the user clicks the cell.

3. Adding Error Alert

Prevents incorrect data entry.

Example:

Title: Invalid Entry

Message: Only values from the drop-down are allowed.

Choose Style:

Stop → blocks incorrect entry

Warning → asks before accepting

Information → notifies only

b. Advanced Functions (SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, AVERAGEIFS)

- Thhese function are very useful in data analysis and manupulating data from large sheets

These are multi-condition functions used for filtered analysis.

1. SUMIFS() – Sum with Multiple Conditions

Problem : Sum the total sales for "Printer" in the "East" region.

=SUMIFS(F6:F11, C6:C11, "Printer", G6:G11, "East")

a. first column for total sales
b. second column for product list
c. item name whose total to sum
d. third column for region
e. region name for the product sum

2. COUNTIFS() – Count with Multiple Conditions

Problem : Count how many Printers were sold in the East region.

=COUNTIFS(c6:c11, "Printer", g6:g11, "East")

a. first column for the product names
b. product name to count
c. second olumn for region names
d. region name


3. AVERAGEIFS() – Average with Multiple Conditions

Problem : Calculate average sales of Shampoo in North region.

=AVERAGEIFS(F6:F11, C6:C11, "Printer", G6:G11, "East")


a. first column for total sales
b. second column for product list
c. item name whose total to sum
d. third column for region
e. region name for the product sum

c. Excel graphs and charts

Excel charts are used to transform raw data into meaningful visual insights. They help identify trends, patterns, comparisons, and distributions easily.

This guide covers the most important graphs used in reporting, dashboards, and data analysis.

1. Column Chart (Vertical Bars)

Best for: Comparing values across categories.

2. Bar Chart (Horizontal Bars)

Best for: Long category names; comparing many categories.

Example

Product-wise sales:

Shampoo: 5000

Soap: 9000

Facewash: 3000

3. Line Chart

Best for: Showing trends over time.

Example: Monthly Website Visitors

Month	Visitors
Jan	10,000
Feb	12,500
Mar	14,000
Apr   15,000

Line chart shows growth trend clearly.

4. Pie Chart

Best for: Showing parts of a whole (percentages).

Example: Market Share of OTT platform
Brand	Market Share (%)

Ott            Share
Netflix			40%
Amazon Prime	35%
Hotstar 			25%

Pie chart shows size of each slice (A > B > C).

5. Doughnut Chart

A circular version of a Pie chart, but can show multiple categories.

Example:

Expense distribution:

Rent: 35%

Groceries: 25%

Travel: 15%

Other: 25%

Looks modern and useful in dashboards.

6. Area Chart

Best for: Showing cumulative total over time.

Example

Revenue over years:

Year	Revenue
2020	15,00,000
2021	17,50,000
2022	19,00,000

Area chart visualizes not just growth but volume.

Column Chart, Bar Chart, Line Chart, Pie Chart, Doughnut Chart, Area Chart


7. Scatter Plot (XY Chart)

- Scatter plot is very import graph where the data values are related as X and Y.

- It show relationship between two variables.

Best for: Showing relationship between two numeric variables.

Example

Study: Hours spent vs Exam score

Hours	Score
1	40

Load Data → Import from source

Transform Data → Apply steps (remove duplicates, change types, merge tables)

Load to Excel/Power BI → Output clean dataset

Benefits:

Saves time by automating ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

Handles large datasets efficiently

Provides reproducible steps (query history)

B. Dashboards in Excel

Definition: A visual interface that displays KPIs, metrics, and data summaries in charts, tables, and visuals for decision-making.

Key Components:

1. Charts (bar, line, pie, combo)

2. PivotTables & PivotCharts

3. Slicers & Timelines (for interactivity)

4. Conditional Formatting

5. Linked Power Query datasets

Best Practices:

1. Keep design clean and uncluttered

2. Use consistent colors and fonts

3. Highlight key metrics (KPIs)

4. Add interactivity (filters, slicers)

5. Ensure data refresh is automated via Power Query

Workflow:

Prepare Data → Clean using Power Query

Create PivotTables/Charts → Summarize data

Add Interactivity → Slicers, timelines

Design Layout → Arrange visuals logically

Automate Refresh → Connect dashboard to queries

Suggested Excel Table Layout


Example Scenario

You have two datasets:

Sales Data (CSV file) → contains Date, Product, Region, Sales

Product Info (Excel table) → contains Product ID, Product Name, Category

You want to:

Clean and merge the data using Power Query

Build a Dashboard showing sales trends, top products, and regional performance

Step 1: Import Data with Power Query

Go to Data → Get Data → From File → From Workbook/CSV.

Load both datasets into Power Query.

In Power Query Editor:

Rename columns for consistency.

Change data types (e.g., Date column → Date type, Sales → Number).

Remove duplicates if needed.

Merge Queries: Join Sales Data with Product Info using Product ID.

Add Calculated Columns (e.g., Profit = Sales × 0.2).

Click Close & Load → Load to Excel as a table.

Step 2: Build PivotTables

Insert a PivotTable from the cleaned query output.

Create multiple PivotTables:

Sales by Region (Rows: Region, Values: Sales)

Top Products (Rows: Product Name, Values: Sales, Sort Descending)

Monthly Sales Trend (Rows: Date grouped by Month, Values: Sales)

Step 3: Add Charts

Insert PivotCharts:

Bar chart for Top Products

Line chart for Monthly Sales Trend

Pie chart for Sales by Region

Step 4: Add Interactivity

Insert Slicers for:

Region

Product Category

Date (Timeline)

Connect slicers to all PivotTables so filters apply across the dashboard.

Step 5: Design Dashboard

Create a new sheet called Dashboard.

Arrange charts and PivotTables neatly:

Top row → KPIs (Total Sales, Avg Sales per Region, Top Product)

Middle → Trend chart

Bottom → Regional breakdown + product chart

Add titles and consistent colors.

Example Layout in Excel
KPI	Value
Total Sales	$1,250,000
Top Product	Laptop
Best Region	West
Charts:

Line chart → Monthly Sales Trend

Bar chart → Top Products

Pie chart → Regional Sales Share

With this setup, whenever you refresh the Power Query, the dashboard updates automatically — no manual work needed.


Example Dataset 1: Sales Data (CSV or Excel Table)
Paste this into a sheet called SalesData:

How to Use Power Query
Go to Data → Get Data → From Table/Range for both sheets.

In Power Query Editor:

Ensure column types are correct (Date, Text, Number).

Merge SalesData with ProductInfo using Product ID.

Result: A combined table with Date, Region, Sales, Product Name, Category.

Load the merged query back into Excel.

Build Dashboard

Insert a PivotTable from the merged query.

Create visuals:

Line Chart → Sales over time (Date vs Sales).

Bar Chart → Top Products (Product Name vs Sales).

Pie Chart → Regional Sales Share (Region vs Sales).

Add Slicers for:

Region

Category

Date (Timeline)

Arrange charts neatly on a new sheet called Dashboard.

📊 Example Dashboard Layout
